<h1>Introduction To Dark Web</h1>
<h4 style="color:white;">The dark web is the World Wide Web content that exists on darknets, overlay networks that use the Internet but require specific software, configurations or authorization to access. The dark web forms a small part of the deep web, the part of the Web not indexed by web search engines, although sometimes the term deep web is mistakenly used to refer specifically to the dark web.
<p>
The darknets which constitute the dark web include small, friend-to-friend peer-to-peer networks, as well as large, popular networks like Tor, Freenet, I2P and Riffle operated by public organizations and individuals. Users of the dark web refer to the regular web as Clearnet due to its unencrypted nature. The Tor dark web may be referred to as onionland, a reference to the network's top-level domain suffix .onion and the traffic anonymization technique of onion routing.</h4></P>
<h1 style="text-align:left;">Terminology</h1>
<h4 style="color:white;">The dark web has often been confused with the deep web, which refer to the parts of the web not indexed (searchable) by search engines. This confusion dates back to at least 2009.Since then, especially in reporting on Silk Road, the two terms have often been conflated,despite recommendations that they should be distinguished.</h4>
